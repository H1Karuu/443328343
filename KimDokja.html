          <h1>Appearance</h1>
          <p>Kim Dokja has a thin face and pale skin. His hair is thin and black; he has long eyelashes and dark circles.[3] His countenance is calm and fresh, although somewhat edgy. There is a marked difference in his appearance when he smiles and when he's expressionless. As an adult, he has a slender physique, being rather skinny prior to the beginning of the scenarios, although he has become rather muscular due to raising his Strength stat.[4] He has burn scarring/tanning due to the probability storm he weathered after Gigantomachia.[5] He also has scars on his hands[6] and presumably the rest of his body as well from the numerous fights he has been through. The number 6424 is "stitched" into his left forearm, from his brief period masquerading as a Removal Slave in the 73rd Demon Realm.[7]

            He is often described as looking plain or unappealing by other characters, so much so that he gains the Incarnation modifier "Ugliest King". It is later revealed that his appearance is "censored" for those looking at him. In Dark Castle, Lee Jihye says she cannot remember what he looks like;[1] in the 73rd Demon Realm, when footage of the 73rd Demon King scenario is being shown in the Syswitz Complex, Kim Dokja himself notices that his face is distorted onscreen.[8]
            
            Kim Dokja is fairly expressive and has distinct mannerisms, though he may not realize it himself. He tilts his head slightly when worrying about the kids. When he thinks about his mother, his eyes close and his eyelids twitch slightly. He smiles mischievously and arches his eyebrows when he's teasing (generally towards Han Sooyoung). He gets a glint in his eyes when he thinks about his most loved stories.[9] According to Shin Yoosung, his nostrils flare when he lies.[10] He has a distinctive smile, sometimes described as "unlucky" by his party members[3][11] and unique enough in nature that people recognize him by it.[12]
            
            As a 15-year-old child, Kim Dokja was relatively small-statured, enough so to be mistaken for an elementary schooler, suggesting some amount of impaired growth or undernourishment. He wore a middle school uniform and carried a thick school bag with himself.</p>
